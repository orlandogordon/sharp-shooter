# NFL Betting Data Workflow - Progress Log

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive NFL betting data tracking system that starts with Google Sheets for immediate use and prepares for database migration by midseason. Focus on line movement tracking, enhanced pick analysis, and flexible data sourcing.

## Revised Architecture Decisions

### Tab Structure (Database-Optimized)
```
Week_X_NFL_Betting_2025.xlsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Overview (Dashboard/Summary)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game_Lines (All games consolidated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player_Props (All props consolidated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Anytime_TD_Props (Separate anytime touchdown props)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ My_Picks (Pick tracking)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Results (Outcome tracking)
```

### Key Design Principles
- **Database-ready structure**: Each tab = future database table
- **Flexible data sourcing**: Support Odds API + multiple scrapers
- **Reference data ready**: Placeholder columns for seasonal analytics
- **4-snapshot tracking**: Complete line movement history
